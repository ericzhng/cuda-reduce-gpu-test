# Summation by reduction in GPU using CUDA

Reduction is popularly used for summation in either cpu or gpu code. Comparisons between different implementations of reduction code are done using CUDA C/C++.

### Note

The ideas are referred from [1] where the author discussed in detail the implementations. This code is to verify the implementation for data size of power of 2 or not.
